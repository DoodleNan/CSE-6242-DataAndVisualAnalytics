For each tree in forest, I generate boostraping dataset and train a decision tree: 
(1) loop through all features of all records to find best split point which has maximum info gain.
(2) split dataset by selected feature and remove it
(3) recursion ends when there is no feature for spliting or all records belongs to the same group.

I choose it because it is simple and efficient, easy to implement.
The OOB estimate is 0.9458.
