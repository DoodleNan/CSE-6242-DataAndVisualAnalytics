Section A
1. 
	RandomForest -P 100 -I 100 -num-slots 1 -K 0 -M 1.0 -V 0.001 -S 1
	Time taken to build model: 0.28 seconds
	Overall accuracy: 97.0717%
	Confusion Matrix
   a   b   <-- classified as
 432  12 |   a = 0
   8 231 |   b = 1

2.
	Logistic -R 1.0E-8 -M -1 -num-decimal-places 4
	Time taken to build: 0.37 seconds
	overall accuracy: 96.7789%
	Confusion Matrix
   a   b   <-- classified as
 434  10 |   a = 0
  12 227 |   b = 1

Section B
1. The result of Weka is 97.0717% compared to my result 94.58% because my implementation do not use 10 fold cross validation. Weka has max-depth control (5) and numeriteration(100). These parameters will control the convergency speed and accuracy
2. I choose logistic classifier. Random forest excels in running time and accuracy, and more records are classified by random forest as 0 than logistic classifier. Random forest algorithm takes advantages of bootstrapping dataset which avoids overfitting.
